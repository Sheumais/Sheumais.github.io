<strong>
Abstract:
</strong><br>
It is well known that the Euler characteristic of the boundary complex of every even-dimensional convex polytope vanishes. In other words, there are equally many odd-dimensional faces as there are even-dimensional faces. This opens the possibility of a symmetric design on high-dimensional spheres. Searching through the dimensions <em>4</em> to <em>24</em>, we have found slices of the well-known Leech lattice that give a multi-cover of the two-dimensional sphere into hexagons. Using extensive computer calculations, we found the parameters under which the layers of the multi-cover match up. In other words, the layers converge to glue to a regular hexagonal tiling of the sphere: the displayed hexasphere design in three dimensions. Please do not rotate the hexasphere with your mouse unless you are not convinced that there are no hidden pentagons in the design. 
<br><br>

Computer models show that the hexasphere can be physically realized with carbons forming a mechanically stable configuration that is capable to withstand extreme pressure and temperature. Further applications of the patent protected invention include aero-dynamically superior golf balls and symmetric laser-light distributions, which we hope is a modest step towards the dream of functioning atomic fusion chambers.
