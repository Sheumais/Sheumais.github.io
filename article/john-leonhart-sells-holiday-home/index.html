<p>
Reality TV royalty John Leonhart has sold his holiday home on Sydney Harbour for more than 1000 times the price he paid for it.
</p>
<p>
The fan-favourite idol and romance show <i>Crushed</i> winner bought the home in 2021 for $2,000,000. It sold this year via auction for over $220,000,000,000 ($3,500,000 in 2021 dollars).  
</p>
<p>
Located in an exclusive water-front development, where residents receieve access to the SHA Private Boat Dock, Smith purchased the four-bedroom, five-bathroom suite for his family to enjoy while holidaying in Sydney.

<p>
While it may legally be considered a townhouse due to its address within the development, the house is every bit an ostentatious paradise - with a cinema room, tennis court and private wharf.  
</p>
<p>
The downstairs is all about relaxation and socialisation, with an ergonomic open floor plan and trifold doors throughout the home to blend indoor and outdoor living.

<p>
The upstairs deck and outdoor spa take advantage of the gorgeous scenery of Sydney Harbour and feature the Opera House & Harbour Bridge as a prominent backdrop (which can be seen from the main bedroom).  
</p>
<p>
Fans have speculated as to why Mr Leonhart sold the property with some claiming he needed the money to pay off his rapidly maturing debts.  
</p>
<p>
A representative for Mr Leonhart responded to a request for comment stating,
<i>"He and his wife, Rebecca, are keen to spend more time with family, which motivated the sale."</i></p>
